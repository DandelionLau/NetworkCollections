# Neural-Network-Architecture
some neural network architecture in deep learning

## RNN-FCN
The architecture of RNN-FCN is shown below, which can be used in time series classification(**TSC**). The LSTM units can be replaced by GRU units or bidirectional RNN units.This network is accomplished on **Keras**.
